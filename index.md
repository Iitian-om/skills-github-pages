Title: # Newton's Contributions to Calculus
---

Isaac Newton, one of the most influential scientists of all time, made significant contributions to the field of calculus. Alongside Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Newton is credited with the development of calculus, a branch of mathematics that deals with rates of change and the accumulation of quantities.

## Differentiation

Differentiation is a core concept in calculus that involves finding the rate at which a quantity changes. Newton's method of fluxions, as he called it, was used to describe the motion of objects. He introduced the idea of a derivative, which is the rate of change of a function with respect to a variable.

### Mathematical Illustration

Consider the function \( f(x) = x^2 \). The derivative of this function is calculated as follows:

\[ f'(x) = \lim_{{h \to 0}} \frac{{f(x+h) - f(x)}}{h} \]

For \( f(x) = x^2 \):

\[ f'(x) = \lim_{{h \to 0}} \frac{{(x+h)^2 - x^2}}{h} = \lim_{{h \to 0}} \frac{{x^2 + 2xh + h^2 - x^2}}{h} = \lim_{{h \to 0}} \frac{{2xh + h^2}}{h} = 2x \]

Thus, the derivative of \( x^2 \) is \( 2x \).

## Integration

Integration is the process of finding the total accumulation of a quantity, often represented as the area under a curve. Newton's contributions to integration were crucial for solving problems related to motion and area.

### Mathematical Illustration

Consider the function \( f(x) = x^2 \). The integral of this function over the interval \([a, b]\) is calculated as follows:

\[ \int_a^b x^2 \, dx = \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} \right]_a^b = \frac{b^3}{3} - \frac{a^3}{3} \]

This integral represents the area under the curve \( y = x^2 \) between \( x = a \) and \( x = b \).

## Timeline of Contributions
